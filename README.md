# Integration-for-Modbus-TTL-Gateways
This custom Home Assistant integration enables communication with Modbus devices via a Modbus TTL gateway. It uses YAML configuration files to define device registers and coils, mapping them to Home Assistant entities like sensors, switches, numbers, and more. It supports both monitoring (read-only) and control (read/write) operations.
